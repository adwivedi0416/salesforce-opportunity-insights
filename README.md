Salesforce Opportunity Insights – Apex + LWC

A Salesforce CRM Engineering project that scores Opportunities and surfaces actionable insights for sales teams using Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and unit tests.
This project demonstrates real-world CRM engineering patterns aligned with modern Salesforce development practices.

 Overview

Sales teams often struggle to prioritize deals effectively. This project introduces a lightweight scoring engine that evaluates an Opportunity based on:

Deal size

Sales stage

Lead source

Time to close

CRM funnel risk patterns

It then surfaces:

Score (0–100)

Risk level (High/Medium/Low)

Recommended next step

All displayed dynamically through an LWC on the Opportunity Record Page.
